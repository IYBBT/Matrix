# Matrix
This is a c++ project that creates a Matrix, you can do many things such as multiplication, subtraction, addition, you can find the Inverse, you can transpose the matrix, you can get a submatrix, along with many other features soon to be added.

Keep in mind this project is not yet completed, and I am going to work on it a while longer, I will try and keep all the syntax the same, and not change anything so that you can use this without having to change anything after an update.
